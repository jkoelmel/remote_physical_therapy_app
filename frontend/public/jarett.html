  <h3>Team Lead/Scrum Master</h3><br />

  <p>As team leader, I am responsible for general DevOps and product deployment management.
  The natural overlap between leading a team and managing communication, morale, and scheduling resulted
  in my taking over the position of scrum master as well. This freed up more of my team members to focus
  on development tasks and not have to worry about the minutiae of the development process or interfacing
  with the client. While the development of tech-based products is new to my repertoire, I have a decade of
  experience in naval engineering, product line management, and scheduling of multiple platforms'
  equipment.</p>
